# SeamlessHR Cool Style copy

This Project was to simply try to replicate the [SeamlessHR](https://seamlesshr.com/) site's cool looking profile design.
Note: This is not an exact replica, I was just trying to replicate the CSS and HTML behind it while keeping it at production level standards as possible.
